BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IOBUF_jtag_TDO/IBUF (in IOBUF_jtag_TDO macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	IOBUF_jtag_TCK/IBUF (in IOBUF_jtag_TCK macro) (IBUF.O) is locked to U13
	dut_io_pads_jtag_TCK_i_ival_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed
